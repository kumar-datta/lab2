⭐ WEEK 11 – CI/CD Using Jenkins (Webhooks + Email Notification)

This week teaches how to automate your entire build process using Jenkins.

The two main goals are:

✔ CI – Continuous Integration (Trigger Jenkins automatically using GitHub Webhooks)
✔ CD – Continuous Delivery (Automatically build/test your project)
✔ Email Notification – Send success/failure emails to developers

Let’s break it down in the simplest way.

🚀 1. What is CI/CD?
CI – Continuous Integration

When a developer pushes code to GitHub → Jenkins automatically builds the project.

CI ensures:

Code is integrated frequently

Errors are caught early

No manual building required

CD – Continuous Delivery

After building and testing, Jenkins automatically:

Packages the project (JAR/WAR)

Prepares it for deployment

You don’t have to manually run Maven commands.

🚀 2. How Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline Works
Simple flow:
Developer pushes code → GitHub → Webhook → Jenkins Pipeline → Build → Test → Email Alert


This is the heart of DevOps automation.

⭐ 3. Jenkins Webhook (CI Trigger)
❓ What is a webhook?

A webhook is a signal from GitHub to Jenkins saying:

“Hey! New code was pushed. Start the pipeline now.”

Without webhooks → Jenkins must manually check GitHub.
With webhooks → Jenkins instantly starts when code is updated.

⭐ 4. Steps to Configure Webhook (Simple)
✔ Step 1: In Jenkins

Inside your Jenkins job:

Open Configure

Go to Build Triggers

Tick:

GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling

✔ Step 2: Get Jenkins webhook URL

Your Jenkins webhook URL is:

http://<public-ip>:8080/github-webhook/


(If you use localhost → use ngrok)

✔ Step 3: In GitHub

Open your repository

Go to Settings → Webhooks

Click Add Webhook

Paste Jenkins URL:

http://<public-ip>:8080/github-webhook/


Select:

Content Type: application/json

Trigger: Just push events

Click Add Webhook

🎉 Now when you push to GitHub → Jenkins automatically builds.
⭐ 5. Jenkins Pipeline Script (Example)
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo.git'
            }
        }

        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean install'
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        success {
            mail to: 'developer@gmail.com',
                 subject: 'Build Successful',
                 body: 'Your Jenkins build passed successfully!'
        }

        failure {
            mail to: 'developer@gmail.com',
                 subject: 'Build Failed',
                 body: 'Your Jenkins build failed. Check console logs.'
        }
    }
}


This pipeline:

Pulls code from GitHub

Builds using Maven

Runs tests

Sends success/failure emails

⭐ 6. Jenkins Email Notification Setup
✔ Step 1: Install Email Plugin

Go to Manage Jenkins → Manage Plugins

Install: Email Extension Plugin

✔ Step 2: Configure SMTP

Go to:

Manage Jenkins → Configure System

Scroll to Extended Email Notification

Enter:

SMTP Server: smtp.gmail.com

Port: 465 or 587

Use SSL: Yes

Username: Your gmail

App Password: (Required — not normal password)

✔ Step 3: Add Default Recipients

Example:

dattagoud@gmail.com


Click Test Configuration → You should receive a test email.

⭐ 7. How Email Notifications Work in Pipeline

In the pipeline’s post block:

post {
    success {
        mail to: 'team@gmail.com',
             subject: 'Build Success',
             body: 'Your Jenkins build completed without errors.'
    }
    failure {
        mail to: 'team@gmail.com',
             subject: 'Build Failed',
             body: 'Your Jenkins build failed. Please check logs.'
    }
}


So whenever your build:

passes → sends "Success" email

fails → sends "Failure" email

This is real CI/CD used in companies.

⭐ 8. What to Say in Viva
❓ What is a webhook?

A webhook is an automatic trigger from GitHub to Jenkins whenever code is pushed.

❓ Why do we use webhooks?

To automatically start Jenkins pipelines without manual action.

❓ What is CI?

Automatically integrating and building code after every commit.

❓ What is CD?

Automatically packaging/deploying the application after a successful build.

❓ How does Jenkins send email?

Using SMTP configuration + email-ext plugin.
