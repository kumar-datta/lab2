Conclusion:
Successfully uploading a multi-folder project to both public and private GitHub repositories demonstrates student’s practical understanding of core Git commands and remote repository management. By handling diverse file types (e.g., images, Java files, web pages, and pom.xml) and pushing them to different remote repositories, students show proficiency in:
•
Initializing and configuring Git repositories
•
Staging, committing, and managing version history
•
Connecting to and working with multiple remote repositories
•
Handling Gitignore and tracking large files appropriately
•
Applying best practices for public vs. private repository usage
Completing these tasks equips students with essential version control skills and the ability to collaborate securely and professionally. It also reflects their readiness to contribute effectively to real-world software projects where source code management, team coordination, and secure code sharing are vital.
LAB ACTION PLAN FOR WEEK 3
Objective:
1.
To work on collaborative coding by:
a.
Creating Organization.
b.
Coordinating with others through a shared repository
2.
To resolve conflicts when collaborating on same part of code.
3.
To create and apply patch
4.
Students need to make note in observation book and also upload the screenshots of above executed exercise and scenario-based question.
1.
Collaborative coding. Code collaboration refers to the process of multiple people working together on the same codebase.
There are two ways of collaborative coding:
a.
Creating Organization
b.
Coordinating with others through a shared repository
a.
Facilitating Collaborative Work by creating Organization Organization - Organizations are shared accounts where businesses and open-source projects can collaborate across many projects at once. Owners and administrators can manage member access to the organization's data and projects with sophisticated security and administrative features. Steps to facilitate collaborative work by creating organization are: Step 1: Click on New organization in Git hub Click on Create a free organization.
Step 2: Set up your organization by entering the details like name, associated email, account verification, etc.
Click on Next
Step 3: Complete the setup by
✓
adding members to the group.
✓
Now, the invitation goes to other collaborator and they must accept.
✓
Next click on complete setup
✓
Goto Github and click on Settings → Member privileges → Base permissions → Select write → change base permission to “Write” Next under, Projects base permissions → Select Write → change base permission to “Write”
Step 4: Create the remote repository for storing the project related files in Organization. This repository is accessible to every member of the team as per the permissions given.
Note: The repository can be made private so that it is accessible only to the group members rather than being in a public domain.
Now all the members of the team can contribute to the development of the project and the different files with all the versions and modification notices will be available in the respective repositories and is accessible to all the members
b.
To collaborate effectively on GitHub shared repository by sharing code and coordinating with others through a shared repository.
→Steps for Collaborator 1 are: (collaborator-1 has repository that he wants to share with
collaborator-2)
✓
Go to Settings > collaborators
✓
Now in Manage Access click on Add people
✓
Now you will be able to see ONE collaborator added
✓
After this invitation goes to collaborator 2 and they need to accept it.
→Steps for Collaborator 2 are:
✅ 1. Set Up Git and GitHub
In git bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email you@example.com
Note : run $ git remote -v
If origin git@github.com:OrgYOG/commonREPO.git (fetch)
origin git@github.com:OrgYOG/commonREPO.git (push)
then
$ git remote –v // Note now, not connected to any remote
✅ 2. Goto Git hub and copy url of shared repository by collaborator 1
•
Copy url (option 1)
•
If you're contributing to an existing project: (option 2)
Visit the repository page and click Fork (if you don’t have write access)
✅ 3. Clone the Repository
Get a local copy of the repo:
In git bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
cd repository-name
✅ 4. Create a Branch for Your Work
Always work on a separate branch:
In git bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
✅ 5. Make Changes and Commit
Edit files, then stage and commit your changes:
In git bash to existing file / new file
git add .
git commit -m "Add a clear and descriptive commit message"
✅ 6. Push Your Branch to GitHub
➔
In git bash
➔
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
Note: Following steps needed if you forked from any public repository to contribute (option 2)
✅ 7. Open a Pull Request (PR)
•
Go to the GitHub repo in your browser
•
Click Compare & pull request
•
Add a meaningful title and description
•
Submit the pull request for review
✅ 8. Review and Discuss Changes
•
Collaborators can comment, request changes, or approve the PR(Pull Request)
•
Make edits if needed and push again; they will update the PR automatically
✅ 9. Merge the Pull Request (has to be done by both collaborators)
Once approved:
•
The repo owner can click Merge pull request
•
Or you can squash and merge, depending on the team’s workflow
✅ 10. Keep Your Branch Updated (has to be done by owner collaborator 1)
Before making new changes:
In git bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/your-new-feature
git merge main
2.
To resolve conflicts when collaborating on same part of code.
Resolving conflicts when collaborating with GitHub (or Git in general) is a normal part of team development. Conflicts happen when two people make changes to the same part of the code, and Git doesn't know which version to keep.
✅ Steps to Resolve a Conflict
1. See Which Files Are in Conflict (Say f1.txt)
In git bash
git status
Conflicted files will be marked like:
In git bash
both modified: (Say f1.txt)
3. Open the File and Look for Conflict Markers by clicking on
✓ Click on Resolve Conflict
Git will insert conflict markers in the file like this:
def greet():
<<<<<<< HEAD
print("Hello from First collaborator ")
=======
print("Hello from second collaborator ")
>>>>>>> feature/second collaborator branch
This shows the two conflicting changes:
•
HEAD is your version
•
The section below ======= is the other branch’s version or second collaborator branch version
3. Edit the File to Fix the Conflict
✓
Choose one version or combine them:
def greet():
print("Hello from First collaborator ")
print("Hello from second collaborator ")
✓
Then delete all the conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>).
4. Mark the Conflict as Resolved
Once you've edited and saved the file:
✓
git add f1.txt
5. Complete the Merge or Pull
✓
git commit # Only needed if you're merging
Or if you're rebasing:
✓
git rebase --continue
If You Want to Abort the Merge
If it gets messy and you want to cancel:
git merge --abort
Here below screen shot shows conflict raised when collaborator 1 wanted to merge changes to same line that already collaborator 2 added the line of code at that line in same file but in their own branch.
Example :
Merge Conflict – Changes made to a file by two different users leads to merge conflict as below.
Say I am collaborator 2, now
➔
Accept invitation from collaborator 1
➔
Next goes to Shared repository by collaborator 1 (say abcrepo)
➔
Now open Git bash and clone the shared repo as below steps
Step 1: first connect to this “abcrepo” to local repository by clone
✓
Now change directory to “abcrepo”
✓
Switch to branch feature-abc
✓
Now add line in README.md file
✓
Now git add, commit
✓
Now see status and push to remote branch feature-abc
✓
Now go to Github and refresh or click on “abcrepo”, you can see README.md
Step 2: Now collaborator 2 adding line in README.md, save, git add, commit, push. No conflicts
Step 3: Also collaborator 1 adding line in README.md at same line collaborator 2 added, then git add, commit, push gives merge conflict.
Now open file, Edit the File to Fix the Conflict by keeping either or both collaborator changes and remove conflict markers. Add file, commit, and push.
3.
To create and apply patch A patch in Git is a text file that represents changes between two sets of files, or commits. It's essentially the output of the git diff command, packaged in a format that can be applied to another set of files.
Steps: 1. Goto github and take public project url
2. Clone into git bash
3. Now open file and edit it, add, commit
4. Run git log
5. Create patch with commit hash code as:
git format-patch -1 commit-hash-code
This creates 0001-commit-from-cloned-person.patch file.
Note: git format-patch -1 <commit-hash>
•
-1 means "create a patch from 1 commit"
•
This creates a .patch file for a single commit.
•
Example:
git format-patch -1 abc1234
•
This creates a file like 0001-Your-commit-message.patch
To create patches for the last 3 commits: git format-patch -3
or
Create patches from multiple commits
git format-patch <base_commit>..HEAD
6. Get the path of above patch file and email or what’s up to the remote owner of file.
7. Once the remote owner gets the patch file 0001-commit-from-cloned-person.patch next the owner need to apply patch file in his git bash using git command below:
Syntax:
git apply my-changes.patch
Or, if it's a patch made by git format-patch, use:
git am 0001-Your-commit-message.patch
✓
git apply 0001-Your-commit-message.patch
4. Scenario based questions on working with remote repository
1. You've cloned a repository and made some changes to a local branch. Now you want to push these changes to the remote repository, but you're getting an error saying "rejected - non-fast-forward." How would you resolve this?
⚫
Answer:
Run: git pull --rebase origin branch-name Resolve any conflicts, then: git push origin branch-name
2. You’ve been working on a feature branch, and now you need to push it to the remote repository. However, the remote repository already has a main branch. How do you push your feature branch without affecting the main branch?
⚫
Answer:
Run: git push origin feature-branch-name
3. You cloned a remote repository, but after a while, the repository’s structure changed and new branches were added. How would you keep your local repository updated with the latest changes from the remote repository?
⚫
Answer:
Run: git fetch --all git checkout new-branch-name
4. A colleague has pushed some changes to the main branch, but you have local changes in the same branch. You want to pull their changes, but you want to avoid merge conflicts. What steps would you take?
⚫
Answer:
Run: git add . git commit -m "your changes" git pull --rebase origin main
5. You accidentally pushed a sensitive file (e.g., API keys) to the remote repository. How would you fix this situation?
⚫
Answer:
Run: git rm --cached sensitive_file Add to .gitignore, commit. Use git filter-repo or BFG to clean history. git push --force
6. You’re working on a feature branch, and your manager requests that you integrate the latest changes from main into your feature branch. What steps would you take?
⚫
Answer:
Run: git checkout feature-branch git pull origin main
7. You cloned a remote repository, but later you find that you need to push your changes to a different remote repository. How do you configure your local repository to push to this new remote?
⚫
Answer:
Run: git remote set-url origin new-url git push -u origin branch-name
8. After running git pull, you notice that your local branch is behind the remote branch. How would you proceed to bring your local branch up to date without losing your local changes?
⚫
Answer:
Stash or commit local changes first, then: git pull --rebase origin branch-name
9. You’re working on a project with multiple collaborators, and you notice that your local changes conflict with changes that have been pushed by others. How would you resolve the conflicts?
⚫
Answer:
Run: git pull --rebase origin branch-name Resolve conflicts, then: git add . git rebase --continue
10. You’ve pushed a feature branch to a remote repository, but now you need to delete the branch from the remote. How would you do that?
⚫
Answer:
Run: git push origin --delete feature-branch-name.
Scenario:
You are working on a collaborative project hosted on GitHub with a team of four developers. The main branch is main, and each developer works on their own feature branches.
You are assigned to implement a new UI component in a branch called feature/ui-update. Meanwhile, another team member has made a critical bug fix and pushed it directly to the main branch. When you try to push your changes, your push fails due to upstream changes.
Additionally, a teammate has submitted a patch file with a small CSS fix and shared it via email. You need to apply the patch, test it, and merge everything into main without breaking any functionality.
11. What command will you use to bring your local main branch up to date with the remote repository before merging it into your feature branch?
⚫
Answer:
Run: git checkout main git pull origin main
12. How will you update your feature/ui-update branch to reflect the latest changes from main?
⚫
Answer:
Run: git checkout feature/ui-update git merge main
13. Which command should you use to attempt pushing your local feature branch again, and what should you do if it fails due to conflicts?
⚫
Answer:
Run: git push origin feature/ui-update If conflicts occur, resolve them, commit, and push again.
14. How do you apply a .patch file provided by your teammate and include it in your commit history?
⚫
Answer:
Run: git am 0001-Your-commit-message.patch
15. After successful testing, describe the steps (with commands) to merge your feature branch into main and push it to GitHub.
⚫
Answer:
Run: git checkout main git pull origin main git merge feature/ui-update git push origin main
Conclusion:
The effective use of Git in student collaborative projects promotes teamwork, organization, and clear communication, allowing students to manage code efficiently and track contributions accurately.

Ultimately, mastering Git empowers students to deliver cleaner, more reliable code and succeed in collaborative environments.
LAB ACTION PLAN FOR WEEK 4
Objective:
To enable students to:
•
Understand the structure and lifecycle of a Maven project.
•
Build and package Java and Web applications using Maven.
•
Add dependencies using pom.xml, compile and test using plugins.
•
Resolve errors and conflicts arising from dependency mismatches.
•
Work with parent and multi-module Maven projects.
•
Generate executable JARs and deployable WARs using Maven.
Students must document observations, include screenshots of executions, and answer scenario-based questions after completing the tasks.
•
Understanding Maven Project Structure
Maven standardizes the project structure for both Java and web-based applications. src/
├── main/
│ ├── java/ → Application source code
│ └── resources/ → Configuration files like config.properties
└── test/
├── java/ → Unit test source code
└── resources/ → Test resources
The compiled files and reports are generated in the target/ directory after a successful build.
•
Steps to Perform Maven Build and Testing
----mvn clean install
•
clean: Deletes the previous build (target/ folder)
•
install: Builds, tests, and installs the package to local .m2 repository
After execution:
•
target/ folder contains compiled .class files and the final .jar or .war
•
Artifact is stored in: ~/.m2/repository/groupId/artifactId/version/
Add a Dependency (e.g., Gson):
In pom.xml:
<dependency>
<groupId>com.google.code.gson</groupId>
<artifactId>gson</artifactId>
<version>2.10</version>
</dependency>
After running:
mvn clean install
Check:
•
Gson JAR is downloaded to .m2/repository/com/google/code/gson/gson/
•

Docker:
Docker is an open-source platform that automates the process of building, packaging, and running applications inside lightweight, portable containers, ensuring they run consistently across different environments.
Docker Images:
A read-only template that contains the application code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies. It is like a blueprint for creating containers.
Docker Containers:
A running instance of a Docker image.
Working with Docker CLI Commands:
Docker CLI Commands with redis
Step 1: Pull the redis Image
Command:
docker pull redis
Step 2: Run a Redis Container
Command:
docker run --name my-redis -d redis
What It Does:
 Creates and starts a container named my-redis from the redis image.
 The -d flag runs the container in the background.
Step 3: Check Running Containers
Command:
docker ps
What It Does:
 Lists all running containers.
Step 4: Access Redis
Command:
docker exec -it my-redis redis-cli
Opens the Redis command-line tool (redis-cli) inside the container.
Example Redis Commands:
127.0.0.1:6379> SET name "Alice"
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> GET name
"Alice"
Step 5: Stop the Redis Container
Command:
docker stop my-redis
What It Does:
 Stops the Redis container but doesn’t delete it.
Step 6: Restart the Redis Container
Command:
docker start my-redis
What It Does:
 Restarts the stopped container.
Step 7: Remove the Redis Container
Command:
docker rm my-redis
What It Does:
 Deletes the container permanently.
Step 8: Remove the Redis Image
Command:
docker rmi redis
What It Does:
 Deletes the Redis image from your local system.
2.Working with Docker file
A Docker file is a text file with instructions to create a custom Docker image.
Step 1: Set Up Your Folder
1. Windows:
o Create a folder like C:\DockerProjects\Redis.
o Open Git Bash and navigate to the folder:
cd /c/DockerProjects/Redis
2. Mac/Linux:
o Create a folder:
mkdir ~/DockerProjects/Redis
cd ~/DockerProjects/Redis
Step 2: Write the Dockerfile
1. Inside the folder, create a file named Dockerfile (no extension).
2. Add the following content:
FROM redis:latest
CMD ["redis-server"]
Docker Commands (Step-by-step):
1. docker build -t redisnew .
What it does:
 This creates (builds) a Docker image using the recipe (Dockerfile) in the current
folder (.).
 -t redisnew: Gives the image a name/tag ("redisnew"), so you can find it easily.
2. docker run --name myredisnew -d redisnew
What it does:
 Starts a new container (mini computer) from the redisnew image.
 --name myredisnew: Names the container "myredisnew" so it’s easy to identify.
 -d: Runs the container in the background.
3. docker ps
What it does:
 Shows a list of containers that are running right now.
4. docker stop myredisnew
What it does:
 Stops the container named "myredisnew" (like turning off a computer).

18. GET name
What it does:
 Retrieves the value of the key name from Redis (it will return "Abcdef").
19. exit
What it does:
 Exits the Redis CLI.
20. docker ps -a
What it does:
 Shows all containers again to check their status.
21. docker stop myredis

LAB ACTION PLAN FOR WEEK 7
Objective:
To enable students to:
➢
Understand the structure and lifecycle of a Maven project.
➢
Build and package Java and Web applications using Maven.
➢
Add dependencies using pom.xml, compile and test using plugins.
➢
Resolve errors and conflicts arising from dependency mismatches.
➢
Work with parent and multi-module Maven projects.
➢
Generate executable JARs and deployable WARs using Maven.
Students must document observations, include screenshots of executions, and answer scenario-based questions after completing the tasks.
1. Understanding Maven Project Structure
Maven standardizes the project structure for both Java and web-based applications. src/
├── main/
│ ├── java/ → Application source code
│ └── resources/ → Configuration files like config.properties
└── test/
├── java/ → Unit test source code
└── resources/ → Test resources
The compiled files and reports are generated in the target/ directory after a successful build.
2. Steps to Perform Maven Build and Testing
----mvn clean install
•
clean: Deletes the previous build (target/ folder)
•
install: Builds, tests, and installs the package to local .m2 repository
After execution:
•
target/ folder contains compiled .class files and the final .jar or .war
•
Artifact is stored in: ~/.m2/repository/groupId/artifactId/version/
Add a Dependency (e.g., Gson):
In pom.xml:
<dependency>
<groupId>com.google.code.gson</groupId>
<artifactId>gson</artifactId>
<version>2.10</version>
</dependency>
After running:
mvn clean install
Check:
•
Gson JAR is downloaded to .m2/repository/com/google/code/gson/gson/
•
If version is wrong or not found → BUILD FAILURE with dependency resolution error.

Procedure
General :
Description :- provide the description of the project
Build triggers: here we can provide with build triggers of you choice
Advance project option:
Definition:
Choose pipeline script
Here code for pipeline -script
Copy the code there
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pipeline {
agent any
tools{
maven 'MAVEN-HOME'
}
stages {
stage('git repo & clean') {
steps {
//bat "rmdir /s /q mavenjava"
bat "git clone provide your github link"
bat "mvn clean -f mavenjava"
}
}

}
}
}
}
Apply and save

SBQ’s:
1.
Your manager asks you to clean the workspace before building — which stage in this pipeline takes care of it?
Ans: The Build stage (inside the dir('selab-internal') block) runs mvn clean install, and additionally, the Checkout Code stage removes any existing folder with rmdir /s /q selab-internal, which ensures the workspace is cleaned before the build.
2.
The GitHub repository link is missing in the script — where exactly do you provide it?
Ans: The GitHub link is provided in the Checkout Code stage in the line:
git clone https://github.com/NaveenCK-10/selab-internal.git
3.
If Maven is not configured globally in Jenkins, which section of the pipeline will fail first?
Ans: he pipeline will fail at the Build stage where Maven is invoked using:
mvn clean install
because Jenkins won’t be able to locate Maven without a global tool configuration.
4.
A teammate complains the pipeline is not creating .war files — which stage is responsible?
Ans: The Package stage is responsible for creating the final .jar or .war artifacts using:
mvn package
5.
Your test cases failed, but the pipeline still continued — how will Jenkins behave in the test stage?
Ans: By default, if a Maven test fails, it throws an error and the pipeline stops. In our current script, the pipeline stops at the Test stage on failure, and subsequent stages (Package) are skipped.
6.
Instead of running nightly builds, you want this pipeline to trigger only when GitHub changes occur — where will you configure it?
Ans: You configure it in Build Triggers → GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling in Jenkins. Alternatively, a GitHub webhook can notify Jenkins to trigger the pipeline on every push.
7.
If you replace mvn clean with mvn compile, what difference will it make to the project build?
Ans: mvn clean deletes previous build artifacts to avoid conflicts, while mvn compile only compiles the source code without cleaning previous outputs. Replacing clean with compile may lead to using old artifacts in the build.
8.
The project folder name is not mavenjava but studentapp — which parts of the script must you edit?
Ans: Update all references of dir('selab-internal') to dir('studentapp') and also the rmdir /s /q and git clone folder name accordingly.
9.
If the install stage fails, will the test and package stages still run in this pipeline?
Ans: No. In a declarative Jenkins pipeline, if a stage fails (here Build or Install), the following stages (Test and Package) are skipped automatically.
10.
A student asks where to add deployment steps to Tomcat after packaging — which is the best place in this script?
Ans: Deployment steps should be added after the Package stage, ideally in a new stage called Deploy that runs commands like copying .war to Tomcat’s webapps directory.
11.
Why is tools { maven 'MAVEN-HOME' } used in this pipeline?
Ans: It tells Jenkins which Maven installation to use so that Maven commands like mvn clean install can run properly.
12.
If GitHub credentials are private, how can you secure them in the git repo & clean stage?
Ans: We can store GitHub credentials in Jenkins Credentials and reference them using credentialsId in the git command:
git branch: 'main', credentialsId: 'github-credentials-id', url: 'https://github.com/...'
13.
Which Jenkins plugin is needed to recognize the pipeline { ... } structure in this script?
Ans: We need the Pipeline plugin (also called Workflow plugin) to understand the pipeline { ... } structure.
14.
In Windows, the script uses bat commands — what change would you make if Jenkins runs on Linux?
Ans: If Jenkins runs on Linux, we should replace all bat commands with sh commands.
For example: 'mvn clean install'
15.
How will you modify the pipeline to stop execution if the GitHub clone command fails?
Your project lead asks you to print a welcome message in Jenkins to confirm the pipeline is working — how would you script it?
Ans: We can add || exit 1 at the end of the git clone command so Jenkins stops immediately if cloning fails. Or we can use checkout step which fails the stage automatically on error.
16.
A teammate forgot to pull the latest GitHub code before building; how can you fix this in your pipeline?
Ans: We can add an initial stage like this:
stage('Welcome') {
steps {
echo "Hello! Jenkins pipeline is running for selab-internal"
}
}
It shows a friendly message in the console when the pipeline starts.
17.
Your Java file Hello.java must be compiled every time code is committed — how will you add this step?
Ans: We can include mvn compile or mvn install in the Build stage. Since Maven automatically compiles Java files, every commit will trigger compilation when the pipeline runs.
18.
Tests should stop the pipeline if they fail — where will you put the mvn test command?
Ans: Keep mvn test in the Test stage. By default, if any test fails, Maven returns an error, and Jenkins stops the pipeline automatically.
19.
Every evening at 6 PM your pipeline should run automatically — how can you set this in Jenkins?
Ans: We can add a cron schedule in Jenkins Build Triggers. For example:
0 18 * * *
This runs the pipeline at 6:00 PM daily.
20.
You only want to package the project if compilation succeeds — how would you connect the stages?
Ans: Jenkins declarative pipelines automatically stop stages on failure. So if Build (compile/install) fails, the Package stage will not run. This ensures packaging happens only after successful compilation.
21.
Your professor wants a .jar file generated for submission — what pipeline stage will you add?
Ans: The .jar file is created in the Package stage using:
mvn package
It will be located in selab-internal/target/ after a successful build
22.
A Git clone step is failing due to wrong credentials — how would you secure and use them in your script?
Ans: We should store GitHub credentials in Jenkins Credentials and use them in the pipeline:
git branch: 'main', credentialsId: 'github-credentials-id', url: 'https://github.com/NaveenCK-10/selab-internal.git'
This keeps credentials secure and allows Jenkins to clone private repos.
23.
A teammate wants to see the build number inside console logs — how do you print it in the pipeline?
Ans: We can print the build number using the environment variable ${env.BUILD_NUMBER}. For example:
echo " Build Number: ${env.BUILD_NUMBER}"
It will appear in the console every time the pipeline runs.

Scenario-Based Questions and Answers
1. You have a simple index.html file on your laptop and you launched an EC2 instance with Amazon Linux 2. The instance is running but when you open the public IP in browser, the page doesn’t load. What steps will you take to host the index.html? Answer: Install Apache → Start service → Copy index.html to /var/www/html/ → Allow port 80 in Security Group.
2. You deployed your index.html to /var/www/html/ directory on EC2, but the web page still isn’t loading. What are two possible issues you would check? Answer: Check if Apache is running and if port 80 is open in Security Group.
3. You installed Apache HTTP server on EC2 to host index.html, but the service stops after instance reboot. What command should you run to ensure it auto-starts on boot? Answer: sudo systemctl enable httpd
4. You are deploying a Maven web application onto an EC2 instance. Maven is not installed on the instance. What commands or steps will you follow to install Maven on Amazon Linux/Ubuntu EC2? Answer:
•
Amazon Linux: sudo yum install maven -y
•
Ubuntu: sudo apt update && sudo apt install maven -y
5. You built a Maven project on EC2, and a .war file generated inside target/. You want to deploy it using Tomcat. Where will you place the .war file and why? Answer: Place it in /usr/share/tomcat/webapps/ — Tomcat auto-deploys .war files from there.
6. Your Maven web app is deployed to Tomcat on EC2, but accessing it via browser gives 404 error. What configuration or path issues will you check? Answer: Check if .war deployed correctly, Tomcat logs, context path, and service status.
7. You can access your web application locally on the EC2 instance using curl localhost:8080 but not from your browser. What AWS setting is likely missing or misconfigured? Answer: Security Group missing inbound rule for port 8080.
8. You have deployed your web app on EC2 successfully, but after shutting down your local Wi-Fi and reconnecting, the public IP changed and the app is not opening. What AWS feature helps avoid this issue? Answer: Use an Elastic IP.
9. You want to automate deployment of your index.html whenever you restart the EC2 instance. Which EC2 feature can be used to run commands automatically during instance setup? Answer: Use User Data script.
10. Your Maven application needs external dependencies during build but EC2 has no internet. What AWS service or change can allow the EC2 instance to download dependencies securely? Answer: Use a NAT Gateway or VPC Endpoint for internet access.
